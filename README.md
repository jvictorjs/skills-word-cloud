## Why using Vue from a CDN?

https://vuetifyjs.com/en/getting-started/installation/#usage-with-cdn

If you want to build a quick demo project, this app is a good example of how a simple Vue setup from CDN can be used.

The ideia of creating an app with Vue directly from a CDN is based on:

- No need for specific setup to build: you can use Vue from anywhere
- Focus on simplicity and speed to create a quick MVP that demonstrade the usage of HTML, CSS and JS
- Everything is portable: others can easily change stuff
- It is a simple page with no such complex functionalities.

Sometimes a simple solution is enough.

All of this works within a single HTML page and some JS files.

## It is online!
